# Enchantment Advisor

## The problem

My problem was to find the cheapest way XP-wise to get Looting III on a book. Because most websites or ingame mods only work for newer versions and I couldn't even find reliable data for e.g. version 1.4.6, I made this.

There are many hardcoded values which is why this is intended for a maximised (not fullscreen) game window at 1080p with GUI scale set to "Large". Put book in the top left slot of your creative inventory and open the Enchantment Table GUI.

## Note

Some parts of the code are AI generated as I am unable to write more than about 3 consecutive lines of syntactically correct Python code in a row and am just way to lazy ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
